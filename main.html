	<h1>Time Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to execute based on the input size. It helps determine whether a solution is efficient or not. By analyzing Time complexity, we can compare different algorithms and choose the most efficient approach for solving a problem.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm during execution. It measures how much additional space is required for the input. For example, an algorithm with O(n) Space Complexity requires memory proportional to the input size.
