        Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It helps us understand how efficient an algorithm is when solving a problem. By analyzing Time complexity, developers can compare different approaches and choose the most efficient solution for large inputs.

        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. It evaluates how much extra space is required during execution. For example, an algorithm with O(n) Space Complexity uses memory proportional to the size of the input.
